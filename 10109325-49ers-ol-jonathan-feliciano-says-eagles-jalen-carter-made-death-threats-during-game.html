While Feliciano defended McKivitz, he also <a href=# rel=noopener>indirectly alluded to</a> teammate Spencer Buford missing his assignment in the 25-22 loss to the Chiefs.</p>Jonathan Feliciano <span class=acct>@MongoFeliciano</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>A quick chop is not needed if the guy that was supposed to block him, blocks him</p><p>Buford caught wind of the Feliciano's tweets and took umbrage to the remarks. Feliciano then apologized to Buford, saying he was hungover and should have handled the situation better.</p>Jonathan Feliciano <span class=acct>@MongoFeliciano</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Im sorry bro. I woke up hungover and being a bitch. In trying to have ones back I hurt u. It's f-Ed up and I apologize. You got nothing but greatness ahead of you. I'm sorry bro</p><p>Carter then caught wind of the ordeal and claimed that Feliciano "spoke on" his former University of Georgia teammate, Devin Willock, who died tragically in a car accident in Jan. 2023. That moment reportedly happened during the 49ers' 42-19 road win over the Eagles in the aforementioned Dec. 3 game.</p>Eagles Nation <span class=acct>@PHLEaglesNation</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Amid backlash from another incident, Jalen Carter says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/49ers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#49ers&lt;/a> OL Jon Feliciano "spoke on [Jalen's] dead teammate" during their Week 13 matchup, which led to him being emotional at the end of that game. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eagles?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Eagles&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/CfE0tuLai5">pic.twitter.com/CfE0tuLai5&lt;/a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Willock was a passenger</a> in one of two vehicles speeding in a early-morning street race in Athens, Georgia. He and the driver, Georgia recruiting analyst Chandler LeCroy, died after the 2021 Ford Expedition they were in struck two power poles and several trees.<br></p><p>Carter was operating the other vehicle. He <a href=# rel=noopener>pled no contest</a> to two misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and racing.</p><p>When word got out on Feliciano's alleged remarks, the 49er guard offered his side of the events.</p><p>He admitted speaking about Willock. Feliciano also added that his remarks were in response to Carter allegedly saying he was going to kill him, and that the Eagle added that he would never see his children again. Feliciano then alleged that Carter kept posting his family and reaching out to his friends on social media as well.</p>Jonathan Feliciano <span class=acct>@MongoFeliciano</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you dish it you gotta be able to take it. He talked about my kids, I made that reference. I lost a friend to an accident too so I understand why he was upset. I did feel bad thought about apologizing until he started posting my kids on his IG then I had to get NFL involved.</p><p>Feliciano then posted a screenshot purportedly of Carter tagging him in an Instagram story (click on post for full image) with a picture of the 31-year-old 49er and his kids. He also said he reported the matter to the NFL.</p>Jonathan Feliciano <span class=acct>@MongoFeliciano</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The NFL has all the receipts. I'm pass all this tho. I hope the best for him. I take responsibility for my part. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9l2r1L2pBL">pic.twitter.com/9l2r1L2pBL&lt;/a></p><p>Feliciano then closed the loop on his end with this remark:</p>Jonathan Feliciano <span class=acct>@MongoFeliciano</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y'all can Shit on me for unintentionally back stabbing n hurting Spence.I can take that.N deserve some of it.But that JC shit nawww.Dude wanted to take it to the streets naw I'm too old for that n we in the nfl we got to much to live for.All I'm tryna to do is grow old on my farm</p><p>Feliciano is a nine-year veteran (113 games, 61 starts) who has played for the Oakland Raiders, Buffalo Bills, New York Giants and 49ers. He started for the entirety of the 49ers' playoff run.</p><p>Carter just finished his first NFL season, finishing as a runner-up in the Associated Press Defensive Rookie of the Year race after a 33-tackle, six-sack campaign. Philadelphia selected Carter with the No. 9 pick in the 2023 draft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG6Ac4GMbXCeqqNivK15yailmqyYlrtussSloJyhkaO8br%2FAsqpmnZGcuaa%2FjKOYpZ2eYrCivtOeqWalkZmybrDEmquhZaSdv6at06xkna2inruoecaapJ4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10109325-49ers-ol-jonathan-feliciano-says-eagles-jalen-carter-made-death-threats-during-game.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10109325-49ers-ol-jonathan-feliciano-says-eagles-jalen-carter-made-death-threats-during-game.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10109325-49ers-ol-jonathan-feliciano-says-eagles-jalen-carter-made-death-threats-during-game.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10109325-49ers-ol-jonathan-feliciano-says-eagles-jalen-carter-made-death-threats-during-game.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10109325-49ers-ol-jonathan-feliciano-says-eagles-jalen-carter-made-death-threats-during-game.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10109325-49ers-ol-jonathan-feliciano-says-eagles-jalen-carter-made-death-threats-during-game.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-chilling-true-story-of-benedict-cumberbatchs-kidnapping-in-south-africa.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-chilling-true-story-of-benedict-cumberbatchs-kidnapping-in-south-africa.html>The Chilling True Story Of Benedict Cumberbatch's Kidnapping In South Africa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./oh-you-a-nasty-girl-tommie-lee-sets-off-the-gram-with-half-naked-thirst-trap.html>Oh You a Nasty Girl: Tommie Lee Sets Off the Gram With Half-Naked Thirst Trap</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./oh-you-a-nasty-girl-tommie-lee-sets-off-the-gram-with-half-naked-thirst-trap.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
