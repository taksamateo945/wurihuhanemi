Instead, he largely spends his time honing his furniture-making skills and is considered a woodworker — which is evident in just about every episode of Home Town.</strong></p><p>As well, Is Home Town staged?</p><p>It starred funnyman, Tim Allen, and yes, it was what you might call “fake” and that’s because it was a sitcom. It was scripted, had professional actors, and was meant to simply entertain viewing audiences and make them laugh.</p><p>Then What does Ben Napier do for a living?</p><p>Instead, he’s a woodworker who makes furniture. Just take a look at his Instagram bio, where he notes that along with his HGTV show, he spends his time focusing on “history-inspired woodworking from Laurel, MS.” He’s also the star of “Home Town: Ben’s Workshop,” which sees him spending time with his wood-related craft.</p><p>Therefore, How many children do Erin and Ben Napier have? How many children do Ben and Erin have? Ben and Erin have two children, including daughter Mae and four-year-old girl Helen. They welcomed Mae into the world on May 28 2021, who Erin is pregnant with during the latest Home Town episodes.</p><p>Did Ben from Home Town lose weight? The Home Town star revamped his diet and lifestyle, all while shooting the show, and has lost 55 lbs. over the last year. Napier, 35, said he did it for his family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Erin_and_Ben_Napier_have_a_second_baby></span><strong>Did Erin and Ben Napier have a second baby?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erin Napier and Ben Napier, the stars of HGTV’s Home Town, shared snapshots on Instagram to announce that they welcomed their second child, a baby girl.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Ben_and_Erin_expecting_another_baby></span><strong>Are Ben and Erin expecting another baby?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Erin is not pregnant again, but it is true that she had a baby bump in the recently-aired episodes. The truth is that they technically filmed some Home Town Season 6 episodes during Season 5, while she was pregnant. This means that her second child with Ben was on the way during the new episodes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Home_Town_Cancelled></span><strong>Was Home Town Cancelled?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unfortunately, though, “Home Town Takeover” will not be returning for another season any time soon. In June 2021, when asked by a Twitter user if the couple would be filming another season of the spinoff, Erin shared the reason it won’t be returning.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_homeowners_keep_the_furniture_on_Home_Town></span><strong>Do homeowners keep the furniture on Home Town?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Home Town’ clients keep the furniture, but only sometimes</p><p>But when it comes to home staging, that’s all extra. Homeowners must decide if they want to work that furniture into their final budget.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Ben_and_Erin_Napier_do_before_Home_Town></span><strong>What did Ben and Erin Napier do before Home Town?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Couple Had Almost No Experience in Home Renovation Before Starting Home Town. Ben was a former youth minister with a degree in history, and Erin owned a wedding stationery company with a degree in graphic design. The only experience in home renovation the pair had was on their own home in 2012.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_does_Erin_Napier_buy_her_clothes></span><strong>Where does Erin Napier buy her clothes?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Love Erin’s style sense on Home Town? Good news: You can actually purchase her clothes! “I’ve donated lots of my clothes from seasons 1-4 of #HGTVHomeTown to @theremnantlaurel, a co-op shop with a purpose, so you can buy my gently worn wardrobe while helping women in need,” she shared on Instagram.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_the_Napiers_have_their_baby></span><strong>Did the Napiers have their baby?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erin Napier shared a new photo of her youngest daughter, Mae, on Instagram, as well as an update on how the baby is doing. Napier and her husband and “Home Town” costar, Ben Napier, 37, welcomed Mae back in May. They are also parents to another daughter, Helen, 3.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Ben_and_Erin_worth></span><strong>What is Ben and Erin worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2021, Erin and Ben’s combined net worth is about $5 million. The pair’s HGTV series fame and small enterprises in Laurel, Mississippi have allowed them to amass a significant fortune.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_disease_does_Erin_Napier_have></span><strong>What disease does Erin Napier have?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erin revealed that she was diagnosed with a perforated appendix. Fast-forward 8 years and the Home Town Takeover star is still experiencing troubling symptoms. The touching subject is even a topic she’s included in Make Something Good Today: A Memoir, the book she and Ben wrote.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_tall_are_the_napiers></span><strong>How tall are the napiers?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ben Napier, host of HGTV’s Home Town, is known as “Big” to his wife and co-star, Erin. At 6’6″ tall, the Laurel, Mississippi-based woodworker towers over his 5’5″ other half, and his large build sometimes seems better suited for a football player than a small-town shop owner.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Ben_from_Home_Town_have_a_brother></span><strong>Does Ben from Home Town have a brother?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ben’s brothers, Sam, Tom and Jesse, have been there for them every step of the way, making cameos on the show and on social media. Ben’s parents were ministers and the family moved around a lot when he and his brothers were growing up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_religion_is_Ben_and_Erin></span><strong>What religion is Ben and Erin?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As they navigate their lives in the spotlight, one thing they will always keep at the forefront of everything they do is their Christian faith. Ben, the son of two Methodist ministers, grew up in a religious household. After meeting Erin and tying the knot in 2008, the couple moved in together in Laurel, Mississippi.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Erin_and_Ben_name_their_baby></span><strong>What did Erin and Ben name their baby?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>HGTV stars Erin and Ben Napier are adding on a new addition to their home: a baby girl named Mae.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Erin_Napier_Home_Town_pregnant></span><strong>Is Erin Napier Home Town pregnant?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Just like Helen did, her little sister has made it easy to keep her secret by being tiny even now, and I’m deeply thankful that we’ve had almost 8 months of keeping this our news just for our family and close friends.” That’s right — Erin has (secretly!) been pregnant for much of the last year!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_many_children_do_Erin_and_Ben_Napier_have></span><strong>How many children do Erin and Ben Napier have?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erin Napier and Ben Napier share two daughters — Helen and Mae — and love showing their lives with the little ones on social media. The HGTV personalities wed in November 2008, announcing nine years later that they were starting a family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Home_Town_coming_back_in_2021></span><strong>Is Home Town coming back in 2021?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Popular home renovation series Home Town is returning for a fifth season. HGTV said today it has ordered 16 new episodes of the reality series, starring home reno experts Ben and Erin Napier, for premiere in early 2021.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_the_Napiers_live_in_Laurel_Mississippi></span><strong>Do the Napiers live in Laurel Mississippi?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erin Napier and Ben Napier have become one of HGTV’s most popular couples with their hit show, Home Town.

So, it’s likely that Ben and Erin receive a similar pay cheque, due to the five-season success of the renovation series.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Ben_and_Erin_Napier_both_from_Laurel_Mississippi></span><strong>Are Ben and Erin Napier both from Laurel Mississippi?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The genesis of their story is the stuff of TV fairy tales. It goes like this: College sweethearts Erin, an artist and graphic designer, and Ben, a woodworker, craftsman and former minister, had their historic home in Laurel, Mississippi, featured in “Southern Weddings” magazine in 2014.</p><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><h3></h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ksbB5wZ6lZpmemXqmvsinZKeZoJ6ys3nAnKuumZyhxm6wzmaroZ1drLyzt44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdo-ben-and-erin-napier-actually-do-the-work.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdo-ben-and-erin-napier-actually-do-the-work.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdo-ben-and-erin-napier-actually-do-the-work.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdo-ben-and-erin-napier-actually-do-the-work.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdo-ben-and-erin-napier-actually-do-the-work.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdo-ben-and-erin-napier-actually-do-the-work.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carly-craig.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carly-craig.html>Carly Craig: American Actress, Movies &amp;amp; TV Shows, Mandy Moores Age, Height, Instagram, Net Worth,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./robin-williams-quotes.html>50+ Robin Williams Quotes, Quotations and Famous Sayings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./robin-williams-quotes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
