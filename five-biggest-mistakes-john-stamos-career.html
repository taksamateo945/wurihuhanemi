Despite his talent and good looks, Stamos has not been able to land any huge roles since Full House’s end in 1995. &nbsp;Here are the five biggest mistakes of John Stamos career.</p><h2>1. Trying to become a movie star.</h2><p>Throughout his career, Stamos has also tried to use his talents on the big screen. &nbsp;However, there are very few TV actors who have found success in film and vice versa, and movies just don’t seem to be Stamos’ thing.</p><h2>2. Getting sick of uncle Jesse.</h2><p>Stamos has admitted that he was sick of being seen as uncle Jesse. He said that for years he tried to distance himself from the role, before coming to terms with the fact that it was something he would never be able to shake.</p><h2>3. Not capitalizing on his fame.</h2><p>Sure, John Stamos gained a lot of recognition for his work on Full House, but after the show ended in 1995, Stamos kind of disappeared. &nbsp;He took on a few small roles in the years immediately following, but for a while he wasn’t appearing in anything, and when he did, it wasn’t very memorable.</p><h2>4. Beefing with the Olsen twins.</h2><p>Recently, Stamos announced to the world that a Full House spin-off would be coming to Netflix next year. &nbsp;Naturally, Full House fans were very excited, but many also found themselves with some burning questions. mainly: would the Olsen twins be returning to reprise their role as Michelle Tanner. &nbsp;Things quickly took a turn when the Olsen twins claimed that they had never been told about or invited to do the show. &nbsp;Stamos, who has always seemed to have a good relationship with his Full House co-stars, said that the girls were lying, and had been informed about the new series. &nbsp;Although Stamos has since apologized, things looked like they were on their way to getting heated. &nbsp;But this probably isn’t a good time to be causing problems with Mary-Kate and Ashley, because fans would love to see them return on Fuller House.</p><h2>5. Having a sexual relationship with a teenager.</h2><p>In 2010, Stamos caught some heat after several reports indicated that he had been having a sexual relationship with a 17 year-old girl. Although Stamos testified that the allegations weren’t true, that sort of thing just wasn’t a good look for Uncle Jesse.</p><p>(Kevin Winter/Getty Images.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYq%2Bqs8aeqq1lnZ7Ata3Knqpmop%2Bdu26%2F05qkqKtdmK6zscSrZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffive-biggest-mistakes-john-stamos-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffive-biggest-mistakes-john-stamos-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffive-biggest-mistakes-john-stamos-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffive-biggest-mistakes-john-stamos-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffive-biggest-mistakes-john-stamos-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffive-biggest-mistakes-john-stamos-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amanda-seyfried.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amanda-seyfried.html>Amanda Seyfried News - Us Weekly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jose-andres-19690713-html.html>Jos Andrs (Chef) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jose-andres-19690713-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
