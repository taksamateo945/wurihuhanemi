Before the Kilchers were known for their participation in the television series, <strong><a href=#>Alaska: The Last Frontier</a></strong>, Jewel was already out there representing them. In all respects, it is fair to argue that Jewel is a multitalented lady. She is a singer, an actress, a producer, an author, a musician and also a poet. In 2015, Jewel received the Grammy Awards nominations and consequently managed to sell over 30 million copies all over the world.</p><p>Jewel Kilner owes her early success in music to the massive success she received from the father. As a young girl, she could so music together with her dad, Atz Kilcher.
