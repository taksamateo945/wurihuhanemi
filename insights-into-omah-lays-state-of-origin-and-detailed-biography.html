He came to the limelight in 2020 after he decided to take the bold step, pick up the mic, and venture into the music industry upon discovery that he was less appreciated and valued for the song he helped create for others. Omah had a massive breakthrough in 2020; the year when the Covid-19 Pandemic hit Nigeria. But that was not a hindrance in any way to him as he worked round the clock to get to make a mark in the music industry.</p><h2><strong>Profile Summary of Omah Lay</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Stanley Omah Didia</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 26 years old</li><li><strong>Birthdate</strong>: May 19, 1997</li><li><strong>Birth Place:</strong> Rivers State</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Ikwere</li><li><strong>State of Origin:</strong> Rivers State</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Nigerian</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong> Singer, Songwriter, Record Producer</li><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $400, 000</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Girlfriend:</strong> Unknown</li><li><strong>Kids:</strong> None</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Omah Lay and Where Is He From?</strong></h2><p>Stanley Omah Didia, known by his stage name as Omah Lay, is 26 years old and was born in the South-South part of Nigeria, precisely in the city of Port Harcourt, Rivers State on May 19, 1997. He is a native of Ikwerre, an ethnic group that’s considered by a good number of majority of scholars to be a subgroup of the Igbo people of South Eastern Nigeria. Omah spent part of his childhood in Igwuruta, a town in Ikwerre, Rivers State.</p><p>Lay emerged from a family that’s well rooted in music. This is so because his father is a local drummer. Asides from that, Omah’s grandfather made it to the stage as a percussionist for the legendary highlife singer of the 60s and 70s called Celestine Ukwu. Through the lyrics of his songs, intonation, and phonetics it was revealed how educated, smart and talented he is, even though he didn’t finish his tertiary education.</p><p>Before music, the singer spent most of his childhood and teenage years at Marine Base location in the city of Port Harcourt. Being brought up in such an environment suggests he had at least didn’t grow up in a poor environment. His upbringing in a way exposed him to see the world of music and helped shape him for the fame he enjoys today. He didn’t really live much of his life far from music even as a teen because he started exhibiting interest in music as a writer and producer at an early stage in life.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pjimage.jpg alt="https://i1.wp.com/refinedng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/152839112_891494858312492_8915423661611281591_n.jpg?fit=1080%2C1080&ssl=1" width=700 height=480 data-wp-editing=1 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Omah attended Comprehensive High school, Port Harcourt, and then proceeded to the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State. He first started off as a songwriter and producer but decided to go fully into signing. Spending all his childhood life in Port Harcourt city of Rivers State had an impact on his success as a singer. The city is one of the few cities in Nigeria that has a unique record of turning out many successful young musicians.</p><p>But to further enhance his growth and exposure, Omah relocated to Lagos in 2019 after releasing Do Not Disturb and Hello Brother&nbsp;which earned him a deal with a new record label ‘KeyQaad in June 2019.</p><h2><strong>His Keen Interest In Music Ended Up Outweighing His Zeal To Finish His Tertiary Education</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pjimage.jpg><p>As stated before, Omah Lay is believed to have attended all his education; primary, secondary and tertiary in Rivers State. He went on to attend the University of Port Harcourt after his secondary education but had to drop out as he was trapped between his academic and music interest. Omah however chose to jettison his academics to pursue his dream of becoming a professional musician due to not having enough time to combine school and his music engagements and aspirations.</p><p>This is contrary to the thought of some people that he studied music in school. Also, he always nursed the willingness to be a public speaker, a feeling brought about by his passion to speak and convey messages to people. He revealed this in an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>interview with “the beat FM”</a>.</p><p>Omah’s decision to pursue music has proven to be the best for him so far as he’s seen living his dream. Being among the young and popular singers that broke out during the Covid19 pandemic year of 2020 is a feat that has greatly contributed to his prominence in the industry.</p><h2><strong>List of Omah Lay’s Popular Songs</strong></h2><p>Omah’s songs are Afro-oriented. His lyrics are so relatable and often illustrate the average African experience. As a songwriter, producer, he produces most of his records, therefore he truly owns his sound. His emergence into the world of music came with his breakthrough tracks like Hello Brother and Do Not Disturb which he released in the year 2019.

Like most of his counterparts, he tries to separate family from business.&nbsp; Therefore questions like who they are, what they do for a living, and how successful they are will actually prove hard to answer. The only known Lay’s sibling is Adamma, his younger sister but nothing much is known about her. Adamma was identified as Omah’s sister when photos of her surfaced on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57yKeqop%2BYqcButc2tpmannZa1brjAsqpmq6SWwaZ5zp9kqKqZnLavecCnm2aclamuqrjEnWSboZ%2Bcv6K8x7Jm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finsights-into-omah-lays-state-of-origin-and-detailed-biography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finsights-into-omah-lays-state-of-origin-and-detailed-biography.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finsights-into-omah-lays-state-of-origin-and-detailed-biography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finsights-into-omah-lays-state-of-origin-and-detailed-biography.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finsights-into-omah-lays-state-of-origin-and-detailed-biography.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finsights-into-omah-lays-state-of-origin-and-detailed-biography.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./catherine-zeta-jones.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./catherine-zeta-jones.html>Catherine Zeta-Jones Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./graham-hetrick-net-worth.html>Graham Hetrick Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./graham-hetrick-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
