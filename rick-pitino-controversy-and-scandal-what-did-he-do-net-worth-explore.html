<time>08 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Rick Pitino is a retired collegiate basketball coach</strong> who had a lengthy and successful playing career. Pitino took over as head coach at Boston University for the first time in 1978, and he then went on to coach at Providence, Kentucky, Louisville, and Iona College. Rick is most remembered for his time at Kentucky, where he led the Wildcats to a national title in 1996.&nbsp;Pitino was well-known for his high-pressure defensive, fast-paced offense, and creative coaching methods. He is also well-known for his ability to develop players and attract high talent.</p><h2>Louisville Rick Pitino Scandal And Controversy</h2><p>The Pitino controversy refers to a series of events including suspicions of illicit payments to recruits and a sex scandal involving the basketball coaches and players at the school. The NCAA found Louisville guilty of four Level I infractions, the most serious in collegiate athletics, in September 2017.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rick-Pitino-1.jpg alt="Rick Pitino" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Pitino was suspended for five games, scholarships were reduced, and victories, including the 2013 national title, were forfeited. Pitino filed a $38.7 million lawsuit against the ULAA. Nonetheless, he settled with the institution and abandoned the complaint in 2019, with his termination modified from a firing to a resignation with no culpability for either party. However, the incident and turmoil he had in 2017 had a bad effect on his career; he was fried, and people left harsh remarks about him online.</p><p>Following the controversy, Panathinaikos, a Greek basketball club, announced that Pitino had been named as their head coach for the rest of the 2018 season. He then became head coach at Iona in 2020 and remained there until 2023. Rick has recently announced his decision to join St. John’s for the 2023-24 season.</p><h2>Is Rick Pitino Fired? What Happened?</h2><p>According to the 2023 update, he was not dismissed; instead, he said that he is joining St. John after a mutual choice with Iona. On March 20, 2023, he announced that he has joined St.John as a head coach. He has not said how many seasons he will play for St. John’s.&nbsp;Pitino joined the squad barely a week after Mike Anderson was sacked as St. John’s head coach.</p><p>However, amid the 2017 controversy, Pitino was sacked by the University in October after an FBI investigation into collegiate basketball recruiting misconduct.&nbsp;According to the inquiry, a Louisville assistant coach was engaged in a conspiracy to bribe a recruit’s family $100,000 in order for him to sign with the institution.&nbsp;The University of Louisville put Rick on unpaid administrative leave and then dismissed him for cause.&nbsp;He also denied knowledge of the plot and was not charged with any criminal offense.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rick-Pitino-2.jpg alt="Rick Pitino" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Rick Pitino Net Worth: How Much Money Does He Have Now?</h2><p>People were intrigued about Pitino’s current net worth and career earnings once he opted to join the news team. His net worth is $45 million, and his basic compensation is $7.7 million, according to the source.&nbsp;Pitino’s principal source of revenue is his coaching job. He has coached at various institutions and professional sports clubs. Pitino has received compensation for endorsements and speaking appearances.&nbsp;He has published many books, including “Success is a Choice” and “Rebound Rules,” in addition to his work as a former basketball player and coach.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipopubYr2qwMinpmabn6PBs7vVnqmssV2Wu6V50pyYp5yRoXq4tMCtZJ2hlGK1pnnDqGSnnaRixLC%2B06FknrCgobyzsY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frick-pitino-controversy-and-scandal-what-did-he-do-net-worth-explore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frick-pitino-controversy-and-scandal-what-did-he-do-net-worth-explore.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frick-pitino-controversy-and-scandal-what-did-he-do-net-worth-explore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frick-pitino-controversy-and-scandal-what-did-he-do-net-worth-explore.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frick-pitino-controversy-and-scandal-what-did-he-do-net-worth-explore.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frick-pitino-controversy-and-scandal-what-did-he-do-net-worth-explore.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mario-dumaual-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mario-dumaual-died.html>The Passing of Mario Dumaual: Reflecting on a Life of Achievement</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./music-video-premiere-the-magi-unveil-ten-toes-the-nashville-cut.html>Music Video Premiere: The Magi Unveil Ten Toes (The Nashville Cut)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./music-video-premiere-the-magi-unveil-ten-toes-the-nashville-cut.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
