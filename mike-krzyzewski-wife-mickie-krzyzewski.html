Similarly, Mickie and her husband raise funds for several charitable organizations such as Duke Children’s Hospital, the V Foundation for Cancer Research, and the Children’s Miracle Network.</p><p>Nonetheless, Micke has also participated in various campaigns against drunk driving, drug abuse, and child labor.
